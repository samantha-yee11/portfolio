    <p> I’m Samantha, a UX Designer and Web Developer based in Los Angeles currently seeking a UX Design position. </p>
    <p> My background in Sales and Marketing and natural curiosity towards understanding users gives me an adaptable and
      success driven approach on any team dedicated to their products UX. My love of animation and creating human
      connection allows me to create habit forming products that bridge solutions in families and communities. I am
      always working to learn more about the psychology and future of UX Design. </p>
    <p> I have worked across multiple cross-functional teams, and advocated for design through client presentations. I
      have created focus groups in a recent project with teens aged 9-14 and based wireframes off the responses to help
      them discuss their technology usage with their parents in a fun and engaging way. I have created Living Brand UI
      Style Guides to direct future design teams.</p>
    <p> I am looking for a UX Design role within a collaborative design team that focuses on research-based design. My
      long term goal is to be a Product Designer working on a product that offers Augmented Reality.
    </p>
