      <p class="paragraph">Savethewhales.org is a small non-profit organization's website that is committed to helping the ocean and
        it's inhabitants. Most of their impact comes from their educational programs and helping save stranded marine
        life. Users can support Save The Whales by donating or shopping from one of their partners. It is run by a
        mother and daughter and has a close knit community feel.<br></p>

      <p id="w-node-b603a61c9ed4-0718ba1b" class="paragraph">Save The Whales was designed to preserve and protect the
        ocean and it's inhabitants. Our organization is not providing insights on what we are doing to help or how we are
        making an impact, which makes interacting with our website confusing for our users. This is detracting from our
        credibility which is keeping people from learning how to help save ocean life on our website. How might we improve our
        hierarchy of information so that our customers are successful based on a transparent and easy donation process
        and gaining useful knowledge on how to make an impact?<br></p>

        who we thought had similar traits to Olive. Our goal of each interview was to understand a users&#x27;
        impression of non-profits and to understand a users&#x27; general attitudes toward saving the whales and other
        marine life.<br></p>
      <p id="w-node-fd4e448213a9-0718ba1b" class="paragraph">Through an affinity diagram, we summarized our key findings
        from our interviews. We learned that Olive is eager to help save marine life and she already knows the wellbeing
        of our oceans are in danger. She doesn&#x27;t have a lot of free time and would like to do what she can from
        home. She would be willing to donate to an organization to help, but she feels like many charities are scams and
        will only donate to an organization that is trustworthy with a community feel. Olive also has kids who encourage
        her to help save the environment because she wants to build a better future for them. Olive is most likely
        someone in a creative career path who has children. She doesn&#x27;t know a lot about whales but she is eager to
        learn with her kids and wants to be a part of a community.<br></p><img src="images/Save-the-Whales.jpg"

        through their impact stories because she likes to connect emotionally to a cause. <br>‍<br>During user
        interviews we discovered that our users are hesitant to donate money to a non-profit when they don&#x27;t know
        where the money is going. Therefore, we believe that providing impact data will encourage users to learn more about the
        cause and that we might be able to help if we do this through success stories.<br>‍<br>We might do this by
        highlighting what we are fighting for in our mission statement and providing examples. Doing this will allow our
        product to create a community that earns our users trust and bonds them emotionally to our cause.<br>‍<br></p>

        whales.<br><br>Everything on the donation screen is above the fold to provide a seamless and stress free

      <p id="w-node-398da204eb1f-0718ba1b" class="paragraph">I was the main designer on this project and our team chose
        to move forward with my design choice. To advocate for my ideas I gathered inspiration
        and made some key design choices with meaning behind them to present to my teammates. 
        I wanted to use Typography as more than just text and have it play into the
        design. Since the general theme has an ocean feel it provided a lot of interesting opportunities for the
        design.<br><br>Previously all lines of information were over 100 characters long making them not engaging and
        hard to read. Users tend to prefer 40-60 characters long so I needed to come up with a way to showcase important
        information in a way that makes it interesting to read. To do this I made interactive hover animations that
        showcase specific information for users to uncover. The interactivity and feedback that the animations provide
        create a more engaging learning environment for users. <a

      <p id="w-node-7b09b9aba59a-0718ba1b" class="paragraph">To test our sites new layout we tested five users and asked
        them to find the websites purpose, learn about whales, and make a donation. Through usability testing we
        determined we needed to revise our navigation bar by moving 'Our Purpose' under 'Educate'. We also made the
        donate button a bigger call to action because people were having trouble finding it.<br></p>

        concluded our project. I only coded the landing page and plan on coding more pages in the user flow later on.
        The page is responsive and I used Webflow to help me out in the beginning then used my own CSS, HTML, and
        Javascript knowledge. <a href="https://samantha-yee11.github.io/SaveTheWhales/" target="_blank">Check it

      <p id="w-node-9b9071435a50-0718ba1b" class="paragraph">All in all, this is my favorite design to date! I loved
        everything about the design because it shows my development as a designer throughout the process. In the future,
        I would love to get in contact with the stakeholders and help them use their website as a tool to help grow
        their small organization in a way that works for them - whether this means driving social media traffic,
        donations, or more interactivity to the educational programs while everyone is stuck in quarantine.<br></p>
