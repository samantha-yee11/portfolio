      <p class="paragraph focus-groups">User research in a university setting helped me to develop a theoretical approach to UX research that has a foundation rooted in a co-designing process. KidsTeam used a participatory design method that constitutes research participants as design partners. It takes a deliberate effort to set up a design partnership with a research participant but it creates a balanced interaction that is strengthened overtime.<br>‍<br>KidsTeam UW taught me that equality is assumed to take place in design partnerships by some researchers. However, it is hard to treat research participants as equal and to treat a participant as your co-designer. The study needs to balance researcher and research participant harmony from start to finish. Despite frequent use of the term equal partnerships in Participatory Design with children, very little knowledge exists as to how to analyze and explain what an adult-child design partnership is. Because of this, I was able to contribute to groundbreaking research which is something I am really proud of. <br></p>

      <p class="paragraph focus-groups">The goal of our focus group sessions was to understand how technology affects the relationship between parents and their children, and develop a solution that will help parents understand their kid&#x27;s technology use.<br>‍<br>We conducted and recorded five participatory design sessions that lasted two hours each with seven participants from ages 6-14. We used the participatory design method in which we treated our participants as co-designers and took into account all of their ideas while designing. This research method is a way to keep young participants engaged throughout the process and exercise creativity. After each session, I placed my findings into affinity diagrams and storyboards that would help me dive deep into understanding the teens. I would continue my research by searching for new topics to discuss with the kids that would generate new findings.<br></p>

      <p class="paragraph">As a research assistant a large part of my contribution was analyzing our focus group data. All of our research sessions were filmed and it was my responsibility to annotate the videos. While annotating you develop a closer relationship to participants because you are empathizing with them on a deeper level. Oftentimes kids have a looser filter than adults and speak their minds more clearly which I really appreciate! However when it comes to data analysis, this makes it hard to analyze data while also keeping the data integrity so it is important to be as objective and empathetic as possible. <br>‍<br>My next step was to highlight any important findings in the data. After discussing with other research assistants, we created a qualitative data codebook to label themes in the research and develop clear findings. A code must be specific and apparent in the data and could be something like “family tech usage in the car.” Creating a qualitative data codebook required deep qualitative data analysis and user empathy. <br></p>

      <p class="paragraph">This study was put on hold due to a global pandemic but I use what I learned from this research in my UX designing process every day! <br><br>We left off by presenting concepts to present to the kids that we are beginning to make into wireframes. Designing to foster human connection is needed now in a pandemic more than ever and I am taking what I have learned here to help make new connections.</p>
