      <p class="paragraph">To say that 2020 has been a memorable year is an understatement. The COVID-19 pandemic has
        caused schools and businesses to close their doors forcing the 600,000 students in Los Angeles Unified School
        District to switch to online learning. Many students are left without important resources their school would
        normally provide that are imperative to a sustainable learning environment. The LAUSD website does address their
        COVID-19 response but it is limited and for a struggling child or parent it does not include a user friendly
        approach to the necessary resources needed for a successful remote learning environment.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">We have observed that the switch to online learning has caused parents to dedicate more time
        than they have to their students education. Students are no longer receiving the social time they need to
        develop emotionally, and have become less active. How might we improve the LAUSD so that parents and students
        are successful based on less stress surrounding online learning and more well rounded schedules for kids and
        parents?<br></p>

      <p id="w-node-ed18d165191f-3c2c4f48" class="paragraph">Originally, our team planned on redesigning the LAUSD
        website but after careful consideration we made the switch to redesigning the West Hollywood Elementary School
        website. Since we only had two weeks to research and design we wanted to design something on a more local
        level with a bigger impact. Doing a heuristic evaluation of the current website, there are not many helpful
        remote learning resources. The homepage is overwhelming with a few instructional troubleshooting PDF files for
        technology. The parent resource portal is simply an unpleasant graphic with no useful information. The branding is
        basic and the fun and creative elementary school like feel is missing. Two stars.</p>

      <h3 id="w-node-dad1df883ded-3c2c4f48" class="dividertitle">User interviews</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">We began our user research with five user interviews from parents who we thought resembled
        Carolina and two stakeholder interviews from a behavioral therapist and a teacher. Our main goal of the
        interviews was to discover what resources parents and kids have that are working well for them, learn about
        their routines, and learn what they think are the biggest changes that need to take place in their child&#x27;s
        school.</p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IZxcbmeidFcva_WXztQtdiLV1yMRkRnT?usp=sharing"
        target="_blank" class="link interviews">Listen to my interviews here.</a>
      <p class="paragraph">Our interview key takeaways advised us that Carolina had basically become a homeschool
        teacher and is concerned with the time and frustration she has to dedicate to her child&#x27;s learning. Her
        biggest concern is her child&#x27;s emotional wellbeing because they are not getting enough social time in the
        zoom classroom. We updated our user persona accordingly.</p>
      <h3 class="dividertitle">Empathy Map</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">We compiled our research findings into an Empathy Map to empathize with 
        Carolina about the situation and how we can best define her problems in order to help. The Empathy
        Map allows us to develop a clear user persona.</p><img src="images/Full-Empathy-Map.png" loading="lazy"

      <h3 class="dividertitle">User Persona</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">Based on our findings we discovered that Carolina is stressed but she is mostly concerned
        with her kids having more fun. On her end, she needs teaching resources from the school. She gets plenty of news updates
        and communicated with the school all of the time, however communicating with the teacher is a little more
        difficult and she is struggling to find teaching resources. She knows that everyone is doing their best during
        this time and is showing lots of motherly compassion rather than anger. </p><img src="images/userPersona.png"

      <h3 class="dividertitle">User Insight Statement</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">During user interviews we discovered that students and parents are overwhelmed with the wide
        range of multiple websites they have to use for online learning and the unorganized lesson planning. Parents are
        struggling to keep their children engaged and they are having to invest hours of time in teaching their child.
        Parents are frustrated because they are having to use external resources like YouTube and it causes
        inconsistencies in the child&#x27;s learning. Additionally, we discovered that children have become self
        directed from online learning and are lacking social time with other kids and physical
        exercise.<br>‍<br>Therefore, we believe that the best way to help with the stresses of online learning is to
        provide <strong>a fun and social space where kids can interact with each other and exercise and
        organized teaching resources for parents.</strong><br></p>

      <h3 class="dividertitle">Value Proposition</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">West Hollywood Elementary School is developing virtual after school activities to help
        provide students with a way to build social skills, get active, and have fun. Furthermore, we are developing a
        virtual learning hub to provide parents with the resources they need for a consistent learning environment,
        connecting with teachers, and easing frustrations. Our goal is to help parents and students build supportive
        communities to fulfill the unmet needs of virtual education.</p>
      <h3 class="dividertitle">User flow</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">Completing a User Flow was my job. I knew the flow needed to include the two main solutions
        we were creating for wellbeing resources for exercise and social time for the kids, and learning
        resources to help parents get in touch with teachers or teach their own kids.</p><img src="images/userFlow.png"

      <h3 class="dividertitle">Design Concept</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">From the define phase we knew which features we wanted to include, which pages we needed to
        build, and the information architecture for our site. I gathered inspiration from other kids related applications
        and websites to make things familiar and user friendly. For the Online Learning Hub for parents I wanted there
        to be clear button controls and something similar to a dashboard on an iPad app for parents and kids for familiarity.
         The Learning Hub also includes many micro interactions that provide
        positive feedback for parents and students to encourage users who have been frustrated for the past few months
        and feeling defeated. The Learning Hub was my main design focus but I also created a design solution for virtual
        after school care that requires no cost to parents or the school for an easy implementation. Our group
        collaborated by each creating a design solution and chose the one created. </p><a id="w-node-6ae903a32d5f-3c2c4f48"

      <p class="paragraph">I wanted to include clean, fun, and relatable UI components for kids. I gathered
        inspiration from iPad apps that kids are used to interacting with and I knew I needed to rely on large buttons
        and iconography, animations and micro-interactions, lots of whitespace, and an engaging and fun color palate. I
        kept these concepts in mind while designing the UI Style Guide.</p><img src="images/colorSwatch.png"

      <h3 class="dividertitle">Front End Coding</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">Our group finalized our design choice and style guide and we moved on to the front end
        development phase. We chose to use Bootstrap 4 while coding our design. This was my first time working with
        Bootstrap and we have a complicated relationship, but I had a great time learning how to work with it and
        customize it. </p><a id="w-node-37afd71635a2-3c2c4f48" href="https://samantha-yee11.github.io/WeHoElementary/"

      <h3 class="dividertitle">Key Takeaways</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">My key takeaways from this project are that I really enjoy working with families and
        encouraging people to connect through design. I also learned Bootstrap 4 is a lot harder to work with than I
        thought. I am continuing to develop my methods for designing in a team environment and have a new appreciation
        for my teammates and their abilities. </p>
      <h3 class="dividertitle">Next Steps</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">Next steps for team BOBS (our initials) include contacting the school to see how they like
        our design! We would also love to do some further testing on the Learning Hub and see how we can improve it.
        Since video classrooms are a relatively new adoption we would love to spend more time researching them and see
        how we can implement a kid-friendly design to them.</p><br><br><br><br>
